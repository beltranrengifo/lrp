# LRP

My personal collection of shortcuts for most common actions during Liferay product development. I do this for fun and for messing around with [`Commander`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander), but it also allows me have to remember less stuff.

## Commands

### Build

`lrp build` executes the `ant all` command needed for building all modules of the portal. Used almost every day.

### Clean

`lrp clean` removes all files created in the local repository. Used when unexpected behaviours occur, rarely.

### Deploy

`lrp deploy` builds the module where executed. Used intensively ðŸ˜…

- Use `-a` option to use a fast deploy without installing dependencies.
- Use `-w` option for watching for changes.

### Format

`lrp format` performs a formatter to the source code of the module where executed. Used often.

### Morning

`lrp morning` is a convenience command executed almost daily. It stop the portal, if running, updates the code, restores the SQL database and run the portal again. Used daily.

### Restore SQL

`lrp restore-sql` deletes and creates a new sql database for the portal with the default configs. Used daily.

### Start

`lrp start` runs the tomcat server and starts the Liferay Portal. Used intensively ðŸ˜…

### Stop

`lrp stop` stops the tomcat server and kills the process. Used intensively ðŸ˜…

### Update repo

`lrp update-repo` checkouts to master branch, fetches from upstream/master and pushes to origin/master. Used daily.

## Configuration

Do you want to use this commands in you local environment?
